Hi everyone,

over the last months we have seen need to provide a more comprehensive alternative example application over the commonly known Jmix Petclinic example.

This is why we came up with an additional demo, that we would like to present you today:

# Jmix Bookstore

The Jmix Bookstore example application is a comprehensive example of what advanced capabilities Jmix provides for application developers. Compared to the Jmix Petclinic example application, the Bookstore is way bigger, covers more advanced use-cases and shows the capabilities of various add-ons (free as well as premium) and their integration into a Jmix application.

## Add-ons

The application is also a show-case application for multiple add-ons from the Jmix Marketplace. Jmix Bookstore uses the following add-ons:

Multi-Tenancy
Email
Reports
data-tools
Quartz
BPM (premium)
Notifications (premium)
Maps (premium)

## Online Demo
The demo of the Jmix Bookstore is available at demo.jmix.io/bookstore.
